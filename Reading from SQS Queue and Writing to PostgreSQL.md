# Reading from SQS Queue and Writing to PostgreSQL

## Project Overview
This application demonstrates how to read JSON data from an AWS SQS queue, perform data processing, and then write the processed data to a PostgreSQL database. The project uses a local environment with AWS LocalStack and PostgreSQL, so you don't need an AWS account to run it.

## How to Run the Application

### Prepare the Environment
Before running the application, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- Docker
- docker-compose
- Python
- pip (Python package manager)

### Start the Local Environment
Launch the local environment, including AWS LocalStack and PostgreSQL, using the following docker-compose file:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

### Configure AWS CLI

Before running the application, you need to configure AWS CLI. Run the following command and follow the prompts to configure it:

```
shellCopy code
aws configure
```

### Run the Application

Now you can run the Data Engineer application:

```
shellCopy code
python dataengineer.py
```

## Application Details

### Reading Messages from the SQS Queue

We initialize an SQS client using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and receive messages from an SQS queue. An example message format is as follows:

```
jsonCopy code{
    "user_id": "424cdd21-063a-43a7-b91b-7ca1a833afae",
    "app_version": "2.3.0",
    "device_type": "android",
    "ip": "199.172.111.135",
    "locale": "RU",
    "device_id": "593-47-5928"
}
```

### Data Processing and PII Masking

In this application, you can perform any necessary processing on the messages, including masking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data to protect user privacy. You can add appropriate logic in the code to meet data masking requirements.

### Writing Data to PostgreSQL

We use the psycopg2 library to connect to the local PostgreSQL database and insert the processed data into a table named `user_logins`.

## Deployment to Production

To deploy this application to a production environment, consider the following:

- Configure AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key for accessing actual AWS SQS queues.
- Deploy the application to servers with sufficient resources.
- Consider data backup and recovery strategies.
- Monitor application performance and errors, implement logging, and set up alerts.

## Extensions and Improvements

This application is a demonstration, and you can extend and improve it based on your actual requirements. Some possible improvements include:

- Introduce a configuration file to manage settings for different environments.
- Add error handling and logging for better issue tracking.
- Consider using message queues for processing large volumes of messages to improve performance and scalability.
- Implement data cleanup and expired data management strategies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

If you encounter any issues while running the application, make sure you've correctly configured the environment and dependencies as outlined in the above steps.
